# Probabilistic Machine Learning Workshop Repository

This repository contains materials for a full-day workshop on **Probabilistic Machine Learning**, with a focus on Bayesian modeling workflows and deep probabilistic models using Pyro and PyMC.

## Contents

- [`workshop.md`](./workshop.md) – Description of the conference-style **Probabilistic Machine Learning in Practice** workshop, including schedule, learning objectives, and software setup.
- [`syllabus_NEU.md`](./syllabus_NEU.md) – A **graduate course syllabus** from Northeastern University on applied probabilistic modeling, which provides additional context and an extended curriculum around similar topics.

## Usage

You can use this repository to:

- Prepare or adapt the workshop for conferences, symposia, or internal trainings.
- Draw on the graduate course syllabus as a template or reference for a semester-long offering.
- Reuse or extend the structure and themes (Bayesian workflows, hierarchical models, deep probabilistic modeling, etc.) in your own teaching or self-study.

All materials in this repository are intended to be open and reusable for educational and research purposes.
